# Version Control
Learn how modern software developers collaborate across the world without messing up each other's code. You will look at the different version control systems and how to create an effective software development workflow. You will be introduced to some of the most commonly used Linux commands that you can use to work with files on your hard drive and create powerful workflows that will automate your work, saving you time and effort.

Finally, you will see how Git can be used in software development projects to manage team files. And you will create a repository that can manage code revisions.

## Four (4) modules in this track
### 1. Software Collaboration
In this module, you will learn about how modern software developers collaborate across the world without messing up each other's code. This involves using version control or subversion to bring order to the chaos of massive software projects that have the potential for mistakes and bugs. You will look at the different version control systems and how to create an effective software development workflow.
#### Learning Objectives
* Describe how modern software teams collaborate and work on the same codebase.
* List different version control systems and methodologies.
* Illustrate a standard software development workflow.

### 2. Command Line
In this module you will learn how to use the command line to execute commands in Linux. You will be introduced to some of most commonly used commands that traverse, create, rename, and delete files on your hard drive. You will learn how easy it is to use piping and redirection to create powerful workflows that will automate your work, saving you time and effort.
#### Learning Objectives
* Describe how the command line is and how it is used.
* Practice traversing your hard drive via the command line.
* Create, rename and delete files and folders on your hard drive using Unix commands.
* Use pipes and redirection.

### 3. Working with Git
This module will help you to develop a strong conceptual understanding of the Git technology and how it is used in software development projects to manage team files. You will install Git, create a local repository, create a commit, create a remote repository and push commits to a remote repository.
#### Learning Objectives
* Outline the Git principles.
* Use a GitHub repository.
* Describe the steps in a standard GitHub workflow.
* Create branches and merge different branches and sources.
* Describe how code goes from local development to version control and then to live   production.

### 4. Graded Assignment
